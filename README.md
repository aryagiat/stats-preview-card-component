## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned about the use of ```<divs></divs> ``` to divide parts of the website and how to organize them neatly, and also learned how to create different css styles depending on the device's screen size.

A new CSS syntax I learned:
```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 1440px) { }
```
The syntax above is to add the given style in between the curly braces if the minimum width of the screen is 1440px
